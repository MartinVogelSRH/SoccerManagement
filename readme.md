# Football Data Generator

> Generate football data for our football database manager

## Setup
This project uses `nodejs` to generate data.
After cloning install the dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

### Configuration
This project uses `config` to manage configurations.
To configure your local environment, duplicate the `config/default.js` to `config/local.js` and modify the data as needed.

## What it does
**TODO**: Add nice text here, but for now you need to read the code (sorry)
